\section{Environmental Pressures and Aviation Technology}
\indent The current trend in industry standards for aviation technology is towards more fuel efficient and less noisy vehicles and power systems. Many entities including government agencies such as NASA and the FAA are interested in studying the effects of specific technologies to assess the potential return on investment to properly appropriate scarce government research dollars. In this context, many technologies require reasonable assessments of improvements at the conceptual level, when much design information is utterly lacking.  In many cases, the technologies of interest are new materials, which may simply require refinement of the manufacturing processes required to achieve the necessary material strengths and thermal properties. Other types of technologies are related to the design of specific components which improve efficiencies or operability and durability throughout the component lifetime. Another class of technologies are those which alter the aerodynamics of the vehicle, such as winglets, ribs, or boundary layer laminar flow control.  Such technologies are more dependent on the design of the vehicle and require proper design as well. The environmental and economic benefits of these technologies thus rely upon having reasonable design methods to assess their potential improvements.  One such technology which falls into the latter class and is the subject of this thesis is boundary layer ingestion or "BLI". Rather than being a "technology", it is instead a novel arrangement of the propulsion system such that it interacts positively with the aircraft wake to produce higher propulsive efficiencies. This is done by at least partially embedding the engine into the aircraft surface and ingesting the low-momentum boundary layer flow into the propulsor. Ingesting the boundary layer is beneficial because of the natural tendency for turbomachines, such as a fan, to do more work on sections of the flow with lower total inlet pressure \cite{Smith1993}.  BLI therefore has the effect of re-energizing the aircraft wake thereby reducing total drag relative to an aircraft with podded engines and improving the propulsive efficiency of the system.  NASA has identified aggressive fuel burn targets for the next generation of aircraft and beyond as shown in figure \ref{Fuel_Burn_Targets}.  Boundary layer ingestion has been identified as a potential technology to help enable the achievement of these fuel burn targets.

\section{Boundary Layer Ingestion}
Boundary layer ingestion (BLI) has been known and practiced within maritime engineering for quite some time now. The main effect comes from the propulsive efficiency gains from ingesting the low-momentum flow into the propulsor and re-energizing the flow to a velocity much higher than it would be otherwise, thereby reducing the overall propulsive power required to overcome the dissipative forces acting on the vehicle. In aviation, the gains from BLI are theoretically plausible and have been studied at some length but have yet to come to fruition in civil applications due to the additional difficulty of designing a proper aerodynamic intake which can deliver reasonable levels of distortion to the fan and compression system at transonic flight speeds and Reynold's numbers. However, the next generation of aircraft may have much better performance synergy with the integrated propulsive systems such that the costs of designing to negate the impacts on the engine operation of BLI are offset by the reduction in fuel consumption. One such futuristic aircraft which synergizes well with the BLI concept is the hybrid wing body. The synergy with BLI arises from the large space on the upper surface of the aircraft which is available for the placement of engines within the airframe. There are other aircraft configurations for which BLI could be a plausible option, including the "double bubble" aircraft \cite{Greitzer2010}, which is an aircraft resembling a conventional tube and wing aircraft but with a significantly flatter and wider body on the upper surface allowing for 2 or 3 embedded BLI engines. In fact, the configuration is such that almost the entire upper fuselage boundary layer can be ingested into the engine, which is a relatively large percentage of the total vehicle drag.  

There are multiple engine architectures which are possible for a BLI system, especially for the HWB vehicle,  including traditional turbofan direct-drive engines, geared turbofans, single-core/multi-fan type systems (e.g. tri-fan), and distributed propulsion.  The single-core/multi-fan type systems have the benefit of being able to ingest much more boundary layer while avoiding the negative impacts on the gas turbine core.  A distributed propulsion system is a system with many small propulsors "distributed" over the upper surface in an array type configuration.  This type of system is synergistic with BLI because it allows a very large percentage of the aircraft boundary layer to be ingested. For each of these architectures, there are futher options in terms of the inlet design used -- high or low aspect ratio, embedded or flush mounted, long or short, etc.  Any design method for BLI systems must be able to include the physical performance differences between these engine congurations in order to properly trade between different system options in the early stages of design.

\subsection{BLI Benefits}
\indent Figure \ref{Podded_vs_Embedded_Engines} illustrates the basic difference between an ideal BLI engine and a podded engine \cite{PlasThesis}.  Here U$_\infty$ represents the free-stream velocity and $U_w$ represents the averaged wake velocity in the podded case. From classical propulsion theory, the input power required is given by equation \ref{Power_Added_Podded} for the podded case and by equation \ref{Power_Added_BLI} for the BLI case, where Uj is the jet velocity exiting the nozzle and is assumed to be the free-stream velocity in the BLI case.
    \begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=140mm, height = 80mm, trim=0mm 0mm 0mm 0mm, clip=true]{Figure1_Podded_vs_Embedded_Engines.png}
    \caption{Notional diagram of podded vs. BLI engine design}
    \label{Podded_vs_Embedded_Engines}
    \end{figure}
\begin{equation}P_{Podded}= \frac{\dot{m}}{2}\big(U_j^2-U_\infty^2\big) = \frac{F_{n Podded}}{2}\big(U_j+U_\infty\big)\label{Power_Added_Podded}\end{equation}
\begin{equation}F_{n Podded}= \dot{m}\big(U_j-U_\infty\big) \label{Net_Thrust_Podded}\end{equation}
\begin{equation}P_{BLI}= \frac{\dot{m}}{2}\big(U_j^2-U_w^2\big) = \frac{F_{n BLI}}{2}\big(U_j +U_w\big)\label{Power_Added_BLI}\end{equation}
\begin{equation}F_{n BLI}= \dot{m}\big(U_j-U_w\big) \label{Net_Thrust_BLI}\end{equation}
Since $U_w$ is inherently less than the free-stream velocity, comparing equations \ref{Power_Added_Podded} and \ref{Power_Added_BLI} shows that the power required for the BLI case is less than for the podded case, assuming a constant jet velocity for both systems.  The benefits of BLI can be described, then, as a reduction in the total power requirement of the vehicle due to an increase in propulsive efficiency.  Additionally, the weight of the propulsion system is typically improved because of the elimination of the need for an engine pylon. There is also a nacelle wetted area reduction since the pylon and nacelle wetted area is less with the embedded or flush mounted engines having some of their surface area contained within the aircraft and not wetted by the air.  Lowering the engine closer to the airframe also incidentally has the effect of improving the pitch control of the aircraft with the thrust vector momentum arm being smaller.  

\subsection{BLI Risks}
Perhaps the most significant risk with regard to BLI is the performance of the inlet and fan system.  The intake of an aircraft engine, while simple, is an absolutely essential component whose performance has a high impact on the specific fuel consumption of the engine.  The intake must supply the necessary amount of air flow to the compression system to accomodate the required level of thrust without significant losses or flow distortion which can lead to performance degradation or compression stability concerns. Two risks arise from this problem: 1.)  Engine performance degradation (related to inlet total pressure recovery and fan distortion); 2.) Compromised stability of the compression system due to the presence of both steady-state and dynamic inlet total pressure and swirl distortion.  There is a therefore a risk that the BLI induced gains in propulsive efficiency may be offset by the presence of a poorly performing inlet configuration and also a risk that the engine, while more efficient, may not be operable over the required flight envelope of a civil air transport. Nichols, in an evaluation of the Silent Aircraft Initiative, also identifies these risks as the primary factors of uncertainty for the concept \cite{Nickol2008}.  

There are other ancillary risks such as the effect of the distortion on component degradation and lifetime. Such factors can significantly impact operability costs and potentially offset some of the fuel burn cost savings. There is also the additional difficulty of designing a system which has a highly integrated airframe and propulsion system. This concern is exacerbated by the fact that these components are produced by separate companies requiring the need for intercorporate cooperation to certify this new technology and provide for an economical design. There are also other detailed factors such as the control of a system which is specifically designed to have steady-state and transient turbulent distortion present during operation or vibration which might arise from the same phenomenon. Significant research funding has gone into investigating the possibility of designing a "distortion tolerant fan" which can operate under the types of distortion related to BLI with improved efficiency and stall margin \cite{Florea2013}. However, this possibility remains uncertain as the research is still in progress.

\section{Design Methods}
Before talking about the methods of engine design with BLI, it is worth discussing some general design terminology and concepts. Broadly speaking, there are 3 primary phases of the design process: conceptual, preliminary, and detailed. The conceptual design phase is the very earliest phase in which system requirements, architecture, and basic performance characteristics are formulated. Preliminary design moves the system towards a more concrete physical definition by giving some of the components geometric definition, and initial conceptual performance estimates are modified in light of the new design information. Detail design is the next phase in which every single detail of the design is decided up to the point where manufacturing takes place. This last phase is the most involved, most expensive, and therefore the most costly should errors in the process necessitate design changes. Recent advances in design over the course of the last few decades have transitioned towards including elements of the latter two design phases in the conceptual phase using higher-order physics based tools to estimate detailed design performance. This is happening because some of the newer technological concepts require detailed design understanding and quantification in order to determine the feasibility of the technology up front.  BLI is certainly a great example of where this design paradigm is most appropriate, since the propulsion design essentially depends upon the characteristic of the engine intake and the thrust requirement coming from the vehicle aerodynamics and flight conditions, thus lending itself to higher fidelity multi-disciplinary methods. 

Conceptual design is the most important phase in the design process, especially for complicated systems with many subsystems.  Early design mistakes due to large uncertainty in performance or system feasibility can have large influence on costs later in the design phases, since all component designs depend on conceptual design choices. As such, changes in the conceptual  design of the system can have critical consequences if made in the detail phase and are amplified as the product matures.  This thesis is primarily focused on the conceptual design of boundary layer ingestion propulsion systems.  

\subsection{Conceptual Design Studies For BLI}
There have been a number of conceptual design studies performed on BLI propulsion systems in recent years which will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 2. The most common employ the thermodynamic cycle analysis while also incorporating some method for quantifying the impact of BLI on the engine performance. Typically these are "0-D", axisymmetric analyses that aim to provide thermodynamic gas path properties, thrust, and fuel flow.  These estimates are used for architectural trade studies to determine the number of engines, engine placement, engine cycle, and other BLI related parameters which have an impact on the efficiency of the system. Typically higher order analyses are required for determining the detailed design of the inlet and external cowl shape, but such analyses require a cycle model to create powered boundary conditions for the analysis to begin with.  Furthermore, the computational complexity of the higher order tools preclude their use in a parametric cycle design trade study, which requires potentially thousands of function calls to the aerodynamic tools.  Building a fast, parametric, conceptual level cycle model also allows up-front sensitivity studies on the CFD analysis results.  While this level of analysis is not going to yield the ultimate design or performance estimate due to the lack of fidelity of the aerodynamic tools, it is still desired that the overall system cycle and architecture design is chosen to maximize the performance of the system while maintaining compression system operability.  Otherwise, preliminary and detail design choices made in later phases will be aimed at optimizing an already inferior system.  Such considerations establish the basic need for properly understanding how to conduct a BLI propulsion system sizing and trade study in the conceptual design phase while maintaining a reasonable level of accuracy and remaining within the computational constraints that are typically present at this level.

\section{Need for a Propulsion Systems Design Framework}
\indent A recent report by Boeing and NASA state that the BLI technology is currently "TRL 2" \cite{Bradley2012}.  Technology readiness level, or TRL, is a qualitative measure of how ready or proven a given technology is for practical usage.  The study states that the current state of the technology includes \cite{Bradley2012}:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Concepts for reducing distortion have been studied.}
\item{Some BLI configurations have been conceived.}
\item{Some studies have shown benefits for BLI.}
\end{itemize}

To mature the technology to TRL 3, the maturation plan for BLI is stated as:

\begin{itemize}
\item{A conceptual BLI aircraft configuration will be developed as a focal point for more detailed
development and as target for assessment of system-level benefits.}
\item{A BLI engine installation will be designed and analyzed with goals of ingesting substantial
boundary layer flow while keeping the boundary layer flow away from the engine core.}
\item{Approaches for reducing distortion from ingested boundary layer flows will be analyzed.}
\item{The BLI aircraft aerodynamic lines will be adjusted for the BLI engine installation.}
\item{Aerodynamic analysis of the integrated BLI configuration will be performed for cruise and
significant off-design conditions.}
\item{BLI-compatible engines will be designed for best efficiency given the anticipated engine flows.}
\item{A concept for BLI engine structural integration will be developed and analyzed.}
\item{A system-level assessment of the benefits of BLI will be made from the results of the analysis
studies.}
\end{itemize}

The second bullet in the above list is the selection of a BLI installation for ingesting maximum boundary layer.  The following bullets then discuss the potential tactics for battling the inlet distortion, improving aerodynamic efficiency, and finally designing an engine which maximizes efficiency given the aerodynamics of the configuration.  The problem with this design process is that the initial analysis which determines the BLI engine installation will need to account for some of the information which is to be defined in later steps.  This provides the basic motivation for a conceptual, physics based, system level analysis tool which can account for changes in performance and distortion related operability problems related to design choices made at the system level.  As such, the thesis that follows attempts to build upon prior knowledge to construct a methodology for conducting propulsion system sizing and performance analysis for BLI vehicles.  

The thesis will be structured as follows:  
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Chapter 2 will discuss the past literature and identify gaps in previously used methods to establish the need for the methodology developed.}
	\item{Chapter 3 will discuss the theoretical justification for the methodology and establish a set of research questions and hypotheses to be investigated.}
	\item{Chapters 4-6 will present the modeling and simulation approach, and discuss the results of the experiments to validate the hypotheses and the use of the methodology.}
	\item{Chapter 7 will demonstrate the full methodology as applied to an example problem by employing a design space exploration for the propulsion system.}
	\item{Chapter 8 will provide a summary, conclusion, and recommendations for future work.}
\end{itemize}
