\begin{abstract}
  This is the abstract that must be turned in as hard copy to the
  thesis office to meet the UMI requirements. It should \emph{not} be
  included when submitting your ETD. Comment out the abstract
  environment before submitting. It is recommended that you simply
  copy and paste the text you put in the summary environment into this
  environment. The title, your name, the page count, and your
  advisor's name will all be generated automatically.
